## How to play (TUI)
In the TUI first start a new game with 1-4 players (e.g. n1) then choose a player to start (e.g. a). Now the game will throw the dice automatically 3 times and move your first figure out when the value is 6. Once you have one figure in the field and it is your turn again you can type your letter a-d (e.g. a) and then the game will tell you the value of the dice and you can choose a figure to move with 1-4 (e.g. 1)...

## How to play (GUI)
In the GUI first type in the upper text box the number of players then press `START` now you can choose a player to start with the buttons at the bottom of the window. The game will throw the dice automatically 3 times and move your first figure out when the value is 6. When you didn't make it, the text field at the buttom will turn red and once it is your turn again you can retry to get one player to the field. When you have one figure in the field and it is your turn you can see the value of the dice in the bottom left text box. Now you can choose one of your figures with the buttons 1-4. When you are finished press `neue Runde` to start a new round.
